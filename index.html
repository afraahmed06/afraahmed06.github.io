        <p class="lead mb-4">I’m Afra Ahmed, a dedicated individual with a passion for leadership and community service. Over the years, I've gained experience in various roles, from leading student organizations to working with kids in educational and recreational settings. As co-captain of my school's Academic Decathlon team, I handled the logistics of coordinating practices, planning competitions, and managing paperwork. I also created study materials and worked closely with team members to ensure everything ran smoothly. <br><br>
        
        Outside of the decathlon, I served as President of Helping Our World, organizing events and meetings focused on humanitarian issues. Additionally, as Vice President of the History of Women Club, I worked to create activities that educated members on women’s history in a way that was both engaging and informative. Community involvement has always been important to me. I interned at the Tustin Public Schools Foundation Summer Academy, where I supported students and teachers by organizing activities and helping with lesson plans. I also spent time as a self-defense instructor at the Tustin Boys & Girls Club, teaching kids the basics of self-defense and helping them build confidence.<br><br>

        Academically, I earned the State Seal of Biliteracy for Spanish and achieved high scores in Advanced Placement exams in subjects like Psychology, U.S. Government, and Microeconomics. These experiences have strengthened my communication skills and broadened my perspective. In everything I do, I’m committed to making a meaningful impact through leadership, service, and education.
